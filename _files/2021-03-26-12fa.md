Codebase — a 12FA uses a single codebase and that codebase is not shared between apps.

Dependencies — a 12FA manages its dependencies completely and explicitly.

Config — a 12FA keeps config out of the code, preferring environment variables and setting values per deploy.

Backing services — a 12FA views all other services as backing services, whether they’re in house or 3rd party.

Build, release, run — a 12FA strictly separates the build step, the release process and the runtime.

Processes — a 12FA runs as 1..n stateless processes that share nothing.

Port binding — a 12FA is self contained and self sufficient, requiring no runtime injection and exposing itself on a port.

Concurrency — a 12FA groups processes by type and runs 0..n of each concurrently.

Disposability — 12FA processes are completely disposable as they are quick to start up and graceful to pull down.

Dev/prod parity — a 12FA keeps any environments (such as production, staging or development) as similar as possible.

Logs — a 12FA treats logs as event streams, providing a searchable collation of all process output.

Admin processes — a 12FA treats admin processes, like retrospective data fixes, in exactly the same way it treats the codebase.
