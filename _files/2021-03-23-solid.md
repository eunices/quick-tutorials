# SOLID principles

1. Single Responsibility
One task per class.

2. Open/Closed
Open for extension. Closed for modification.

3. Liskov Substitution
Class A extends class B. Class B must be able to replace A in the app.

4. Interface Segregation
Large interfaces should be split into smaller ones.

5. Dependency Inversion
Decoupling of software modules is best. Use interfaces (abstractions).
