# SQL

## Select

```sql
SELECT *, (c1+c2) as c3 
FROM table
ORDER BY c1 DESC/ASC, c2 DESC/ASC 
LIMIT nrows<int>
WHERE c1 <=/>/!=/=/BETWEEN numeric<num>/'string <str>
WHERE c1 LIKE 'string%'<str> [AND/OR]
WHERE c1 [NOT] IN c(1000, 1001) 
WHERE c1 IS NULL
```

## Joins 

Inner join
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT * / t1.*
FROM t1
JOIN t2
ON t2.c1 = t1.c1;

LEFT JOIN 
RIGHT JOIN
```


Aliasing
```sql
SELECT a.primary_poc, w.occurred_at, w.channel, a.name
FROM web_events w
JOIN accounts a
ON w.account_id [FK] = a.id [PK]
WHERE a.name = 'Walmart';
```


## Aggregation

```sql
AVG
SUM
COUNT
MIN
MAX
```

- `GROUP BY` between `WHERE` and `ORDER BY`

- aggregate (group by) > having
- non aggregate > where

```sql
DATE_TRUNC('second', col)
DATE_PART('second', col)
TO_DATE('month', col)
```

- using numbers for columns in GROUP BY and ORDER BY

`CASE WHEN THEN ELSE END` to generate categorical variables from continuous

```sql
CASE WHEN total >500 THEN 'over 500'   
    WHEN total >300 THEN '301-500'
    WHEN total >=0 THEN '0-300' END AS variable_name
```    

## Subqueries

Provide the name of the sales_rep in each region with the largest amount of total_amt_usd sales.

For the region with the largest (sum) of sales total_amt_usd, how many total (count) orders were placed?


How many accounts had more total purchases than the account name which has bought the most standard_qty paper throughout their lifetime as a customer?


For the customer that spent the most (in total over their lifetime as a customer) total_amt_usd, how many web_events did they have for each channel?


What is the lifetime average amount spent in terms of total_amt_usd for the top 10 total spending accounts?


What is the lifetime average amount spent in terms of total_amt_usd, including only the companies that spent more per order, on average, than the average of all orders.


## Data cleaning

String operations

```sql
RIGHT(col, n)
LEFT(col, n)
STRPOS(col, ", ")
LOWER(col)
UPPER(col)
CONCAT(col1, col2)
col1 || col2
COALESCE(col, 'null text replacement')
```

Casting

```sql
::date 
CAST(col, 'date')
```

## Window function

```sql
SUM(col) OVER (PARTITION BY col3 ORDER BY col2) new_col
WINDOW main_window AS (PARTITION BY col2 ORDER BY col1)
ROW_NUMBER()
LAG() /*previous*/
LEAD() /*next*/
NTILE()
```

## Others

- operator joins

```sql
UNION
```
